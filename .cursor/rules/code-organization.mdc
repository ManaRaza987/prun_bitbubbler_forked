# Code Organization

## Frontend Structure

The frontend is organized around these key files:

- [frontend/src/App.tsx](mdc:frontend/src/App.tsx): Main application component that uses DataProvider and handles tab navigation
- [frontend/src/context/DataContext.tsx](mdc:frontend/src/context/DataContext.tsx): Central data context that manages API interactions and state 
- Component directory: [frontend/src/components/](mdc:frontend/src/components) contains individual feature components:
  - [InternalOffers.tsx](mdc:frontend/src/components/InternalOffers.tsx): Component for managing internal offers
  - Other tab components (Planets, Buildings, etc.)

## Data Flow

- Data is fetched and stored in the DataContext
- Components subscribe to the context using the `useDataContext` hook
- Operations that modify data (create/delete offers) are performed through context methods
