# Frontend Setup

## Project Structure
- The frontend code is located in the `frontend/` directory
- All package management and dependency installation must be done within the `frontend/` directory
- [frontend/package.json](mdc:frontend/package.json) contains all frontend dependencies
- Do not attempt to install packages at the root level or create a root-level package.json

## Package Management
- All npm commands should be run from the `frontend/` directory
- Installation command: `cd frontend && npm install`

## Dependencies
- React 19.x
- Material-UI v7.x
- Data Grid v8.x
- TypeScript 5.x

Current dependency versions can be found in [frontend/package.json](mdc:frontend/package.json).

## Development
Always ensure you're in the frontend directory before running npm commands:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # Install dependencies
```
